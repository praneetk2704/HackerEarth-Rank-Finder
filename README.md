# HackerEarth-Rank-Finder
Simple python script to find the rank of any user across all the 4 tracks (Basic Programming, Data Strucutres, Algorithms, Math) in HackerEarth. Used Beautiful Soup.

Please not that the greater the rank of the user, the more time the script will take to generate the output.
